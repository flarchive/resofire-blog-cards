/**
 * Keeps discussion_participant_previews in sync with the posts table.
 *
 * Registered as an event subscriber (not individual listeners) so that all
 * four handlers live in one class while still being resolved from the
 * container with dependency injection. The subscriber pattern is explicitly
 * documented and supported by Flarum's Event extender via ->subscribe().
 *
 * Handler summary:
 *
 *   Posted    — On the poster's FIRST post in a discussion, insert the poster
 *               into the preview strip if they are a replier and the strip has
 *               room. The OP is never added to the strip — their avatar is
 *               already shown by Flarum in the discussion list item.
 *               Guard: only comment-type, non-hidden posts.
 *
 *   Hidden    — Always recompute. The hidden post's author may be in the
 *               overflow rather than the visible strip, so the guard-based
 *               optimisation would leave the overflow count stale.
 *
 *   Restored  — Always recompute. Same reasoning as Hidden in reverse.
 *
 *   Deleted   — Always recompute. Same reasoning as Hidden.
 *
 * participant_count is owned by Flarum core's DiscussionMetadataUpdater,
 * which keeps it current on live post events. We do NOT touch it in
 * whenPosted() — Flarum overwrites it moments later anyway. However,
 * recompute() DOES write it, using Flarum's identical inclusive formula
 * (all distinct posters including OP), so that batch recalculation corrects
 * any stale values left by older versions of this extension.
 *
 * The JS overflow formula: overflowN = (participantCount - 1) - preview.length,
 * where -1 subtracts the OP who is always shown by Flarum core separately.
